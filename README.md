# Travelling Salesman Problem Simulator

This is a project written in java which provides a graphical interface for
creating a 2D graph of points via manual user input or custom file import.
It will then try to solve the travelling salesman problem via an 
ant colony optimization algorithm. The interface provides means to view the 
current pheromone map of the algorithm as well as the matrix view of the graph 
(this is most useful for asymmetric graphs).
