<h3>
	Instructions:
</h3>
<p>
	Upon opening the program, you can select points by<br>
	clicking on the white area or using the provided buttons in order to<br>
	construct the problem. Conversely, you can refrain from adding any<br>
	custom points in which case the file that is defined in the constant<br>
	String named currentFile within the class: GraphFrame will be used. In<br>
	order for this to work, you must also call the String named FILE_TYPE<br>
	either 'MATRIX' or 'EUCLID' depending on the format of the file (for<br>
	the MATRIX type file, the dimension must also be included in the<br>
	constant int DIMENSION).Euclid means that it is composed of a set of<br>
	points, corresponding to a 2d map, and Matrix means that is is defined<br>
	as a matrix of costs. In order to commence the solving of the problem,<br>
	click on the button that reads 'Display Matrix' and then click start.<br>
	It is reccomended to set the speed slider on the matrix window to the<br>
	top in order tomaximize the amount of iterations per second computed<br>
	by the algorithm.It is also important to note that if 20 or less points<br>
	arevcontained within the map (AKA matrix = 20x20), a visual demonstration<br>
	of the ant agent used in each iteration will be displayed, slowing<br>
	down to algorithm immensely. In order for the percent difference to be<br>
	meaningful, the variable FILE_SOLUTION must be set to the correct<br>
	known value (as located from TSPLIB website)<br>
